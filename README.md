Ecommerce REST API,

This project aims complete backend code for an E-Commerce website.
In this project i have created Intety, Category and Order model which does CRUD operations such as Adding, Retrieving, Updating And Deleting. I have completed complete code which could be possible in minimum time.

In project i defined all the layer diffrently such as Controller layer, Service layer, Entity layer and Repository Layer. I also sepreted programme in different modual but while facing serverside issue i merge all of them together.

For database I've used H2 database for on-site srver which helps to enhance the result much faster. Also Used Hibernate and JPA for evaluate and show my skills. Project includes CRUD operation and the relation between Categories and Item Entities. I used Post-Man API for test cases of an application. Project also has filtering by categoriesing Item and Item's mapped category Id. 

I learned about many new things from this Project and i will also add front-end part and more deeper business logics by the times. Also i would try to deploy the application and enhance my knowledge about Spring Boot deeper. Also i would add more functionalities like Login-Authentication, Front-end part, enhansing categories with more filter.
